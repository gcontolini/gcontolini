- 👋 Hi, I’m @gcontolini
- 👀 I’m interested in marine community ecology, kelp forest restoration, climate change ecology, population-level trait variation, and natural resource management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git and GitHub so I can contribute to big data projects, like those involving lots of species or oceanographic data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on climate change ecology projects!
- 📫 The best way to reach me is through email: gina@contolini.com.
